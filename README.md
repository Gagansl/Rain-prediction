# Rain prediction
 


## Overview
This project aims to predict rainfall in a specific region using weather data. The model incorporates key weather factors such as temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and atmospheric pressure to forecast the likelihood of precipitation. Machine learning techniques are employed to enhance accuracy by analyzing historical weather data alongside real-time inputs.

## Features
- Predicts the probability of rainfall in a given location
- Uses weather features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure
- Implements machine learning algorithms for better prediction accuracy
- Visualizes trends using data visualization techniques

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (e.g., Random Forests)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Data
- The dataset contains weather features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, along with the target variable indicating whether or not it rained.
- Data can be sourced from weather APIs or public datasets such as the [Weather Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) on Kaggle.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rain-prediction.git
